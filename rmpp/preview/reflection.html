            <h2>WHAT: Module Context and Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this Research Methods and Professional Practice module, I engaged with a
                comprehensive exploration of research methodologies, professional ethics, and practical data
                analysis techniques. The module required me to navigate multiple interconnected components:
                two collaborative discussions on ethics and information accuracy, reflective activities on
                generative AI governance and survey misuse, a literature review followed by a research
                proposal. It also included some statistical worksheets covering hypothesis testing, summary
                measures, inference, and data visualisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My chosen research area focused on the responsible adoption of LLMs in e-business contexts,
                specifically examining how organisations can balance innovation-driven value creation with
                robust governance frameworks. This topic emerged from my interest in understanding how
                emerging technologies reshape digital commerce while raising profound ethical, legal, and social
                questions. The literature review synthesised evidence from 2018-2025, critically evaluating both
                optimistic perspectives that celebrate LLMs' transformative potential and cautious viewpoints
                highlighting risks of bias, hallucinations, and regulatory uncertainty. The research proposal
                extended this work by proposing an exploratory qualitative study using systematic review,
                comparative case studies, and semi-structured interviews to develop a "Balanced Adoption
                Framework" linking business KPIs to governance mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the research assignments, the statistical components introduced me to descriptive and
                inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and data visualisation
                principles. Working through the Excel-based worksheets forced me to move from theoretical
                understanding to practical application, interpreting real datasets and translating statistical outputs
                into meaningful business insights.
            </p>

        <section id="so-what" class="reflection-section">
            <h2>SO WHAT: Critical Reflection and Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Statistical Analysis and Research Competencies</h3>
            <p>
                My relationship with quantitative methods evolved significantly during this module. Initially, I
                approached statistics with apprehension, viewing it as a purely technical exercise disconnected
                from real-world decision making. However, as I worked through the hypothesis testing and
                summary measures worksheets, I began to appreciate statistics as a language for evidence-based
                reasoning. Calculating confidence intervals, conducting t-tests, and interpreting p-values became
                less about mechanical computation and more about understanding what the data could, and could
                not, tell me about the phenomena under investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inference worksheet particularly challenged me to think critically about validity and
                generalisability. When analysing correlation coefficients or regression outputs, I had to
                constantly question: "What assumptions underpin this analysis? What biases might exist in this
                dataset? Can these findings reasonably extend beyond this specific sample?" This critical stance
                was reinforced by the module's emphasis on ethical data collection and the Cambridge Analytica
                case study, which demonstrated how statistical power divorced from ethical responsibility can
                cause profound societal harm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating visualisations also taught me that charts are not neutral representations but rhetorical
                devices that can clarify or obscure truth. I initially included a pie chart in my Power BI work
                (referenced in my previous data visualisation reflection), only to realise it masked important
                trends that a stacked bar chart revealed more effectively. This experience carried into the charts
                worksheet, where I had to justify not only what to visualise but why a particular chart type best
                served the analytical question. I learned that good data presentation requires understanding your
                audience, anticipating misinterpretation, and prioritising clarity over aesthetic appeal.
            </p>

            <h3>Research Methodology and the Literature Review</h3>
            <p>
                Conducting the literature review on LLMs in e-business was simultaneously intellectually
                rewarding and methodologically challenging. The systematic search process, defining inclusion
                criteria, executing Boolean searches across multiple databases, screening titles and abstracts, and
                synthesising findings thematically, demanded rigour and patience. I initially underestimated the
                volume of literature and the difficulty of maintaining focus. With too many potentially relevant
                sources identified, I had to make difficult decisions about scope, ultimately excluding purely
                technical papers and non-peer-reviewed content to maintain academic integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The critical comparison section of my review revealed a fundamental tension in the literature:
                optimistic studies emphasised efficiency gains and customer engagement, while cautious
                perspectives foregrounded bias, unreliability, and regulatory risk. Importantly, I recognised that
                these contradictions were not merely academic disagreements but reflected methodological
                differences, short-term case studies versus longitudinal impact assessments, retail contexts versus
                high-stakes healthcare applications, technical benchmarks versus organisational ethnographies.
                This realisation taught me that research findings are always situated within specific contexts, and
                that my role as a researcher is not to declare a single "truth" but to transparently acknowledge
                complexity and contingency.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Ethics in the Age of Generative AI</h3>
            <p>
                The module's ethical components, particularly Reflective Activity 1 on generative AI governance
                and the collaborative discussions, profoundly shaped my understanding of professional
                responsibility. The Correa et al. (2023) reading on global AI governance highlighted the
                fragmentation of regulatory approaches: Europe's risk-based legislation, America's market-driven
                flexibility, and Asia's hybrid frameworks. This diversity underscored that "responsible AI" is not
                a universal standard but a contested, culturally situated concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deckard's (2023) notion of "algorithmic fiduciary duty" particularly resonated with me. The idea
                that computing professionals should bear a duty of care analogous to doctors or lawyers elevates
                technical work from craft to profession. It means that my responsibility extends beyond writing
                efficient code or building accurate models, I must actively prevent harm, ensure fairness, and
                remain transparent about system limitations. This framing transformed how I approached my
                research proposal: governance mechanisms were not bureaucratic obstacles but constitutive
                elements of sustainable innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cambridge Analytica case study provided a visceral illustration of ethical failure. Here was
                a seemingly innocent personality quiz weaponised for mass psychological manipulation,
                demonstrating how weak consent, unclear purpose, and profit motives can corrupt legitimate
                research into exploitation. The case reinforced three principles that will guide my future practice:
                never disguise data collection intent, minimise data collection (especially about third parties),
                and separate research from commercial repurposing without renewed consent.
            </p>

            <h3>Personal and Emotional Dimensions of Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Emotionally, this module was a journey from uncertainty to cautious confidence. In the early
                units, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of research methods, qualitative versus
                quantitative, exploratory versus descriptive, inductive versus deductive. I worried about choosing
                the "wrong" methodology for my literature review and research proposal. The first collaborative
                discussion on ethics also challenged me intellectually; synthesising complex arguments from
                Floridi, Leslie, and Dwivedi while integrating peer feedback required me to engage with
                academic debate at a deeper level than I had previously experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
                The statistical worksheets provoked frustration initially, particularly when Excel formulas failed
                or when I struggled to interpret ANOVA outputs. However, learning that statistics is about
                telling a story with data, not just calculating numbers, shifted my perspective. I began to see
                errors not as personal failures but as learning opportunities, and I developed resilience in
                troubleshooting problems and seeking help.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most satisfying moment came when completing my research proposal presentation. After
                weeks of reading, synthesising, and critically evaluating literature, I finally articulated a coherent
                research question and methodology. Creating the Gantt chart and operationalising abstract
                concepts like "thematic analysis" and "triangulation" into concrete research activities gave me a
                sense of agency, I was no longer passively consuming knowledge but actively designing an
                investigation that could generate new insights.

                        <li><strong>Advanced Statistical Techniques:</strong> My understanding remains limited to
                            descriptive

                        <li><strong>Qualitative Data Analysis:</strong> While I proposed qualitative methods in my
                            research proposal, I
                            have not yet conducted actual interviews, coded transcripts, or navigated the interpretive
                            challenges of thematic analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> I occasionally underestimated the time required for
                            complex tasks like

                        <li><strong>Intellectual Confidence:</strong> I sometimes deferred excessively to published
                            authorities rather than trusting my own analytical

                    <h4>Threats</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rapid Technological Change:</strong> The AI field evolves faster than academic
                            literature or

                        <li><strong>Regulatory Complexity:</strong> As jurisdictions implement divergent AI regulations,
                            navigating compliance will become
                            increasingly complex.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethical Complacency:</strong> There is a risk that ethical principles remain
                            abstract commitments
                            rather than embedded practices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Imposter Syndrome:</strong> As I transition from student to professional researcher,
                            I may struggle with confidence in my
                            expertise.</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This Research Methods and Professional Practice module has been transformative, equipping me
                with methodological competencies, ethical frameworks, and critical perspectives essential for
                navigating the complex landscape of AI-driven digital business. From grappling with statistical
                hypothesis tests to synthesising fragmented literatures, from designing research proposals to
                reflecting on fiduciary duties, I have developed a robust foundation for both academic
                scholarship and professional practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey was not always comfortable, uncertainty, frustration, and self-doubt were frequent
                companions. But discomfort is the precondition for growth, and I now approach challenges with
                greater resilience and reflexivity. I recognise that expertise is not a destination but a continuous
                process of learning, unlearning, and relearning in response to new evidence and changing
                contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking forward, I am excited to apply these skills in my capstone project, where I will design
                and implement a substantial research artefact that integrates technical innovation with ethical
                governance. Beyond graduation, I envision a career at the intersection of technology, ethics, and
                policy, contributing to the responsible development and deployment of AI systems that enhance
                human flourishing while respecting autonomy, fairness, and dignity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module has taught me that data is only as powerful as its presentation, that methodology is
                only as valuable as its ethical grounding, and that innovation is only as sustainable as the trust it
                cultivates. These lessons will guide my practice as I transition from student to professional, from
                consumer of knowledge to contributor to collective understanding, from technologist to
                responsible steward of transformative technologies.
